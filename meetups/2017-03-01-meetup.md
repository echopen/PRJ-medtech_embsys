# Design

## Polytech-team

Focus on two topics :

* Design a unique PCB + miniaturization. @eiffel notices that the Clarius uses 4 PCB : do we really need a unique PCB ? However, with several piled PCB, component shielding must be handled
* Improve acquisition / treatment in the RedPitaya : design an [intellectual property (IP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core ) in [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL ) for the acquisition, implement numerical envelope detection (double FFT) in VHDL (currently implemented in C)

**Remark** : RedPitaya's ADC are clocked at 100MHz which is quite powerful

Next week's objectives : Focus on analog part --> study circuits, remove useless components, study the noise in the system


## Lausanne antenna

@massoud wants to benchmark an ADC to see if he can get a sampling frequency of 50 MHz from the latter.


# Frequencies of transducers

The frequencies of the 3 transducers will be:

* 3.5 MHz,
* 5 MHz (this transducer requires an ADC at 25 MHz to be suitably used),
* 7.5 MHz
