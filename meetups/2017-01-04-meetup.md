## Discussions

### Introduction and presentations (newcomers)
Everyone gives a short presentation of him/herself and his/her interests in the project.

### Current status of the embedded platform
[@jcbillard](https://echopen.slack.com/team/jcbillard) being absent, this point is not discussed further.

### Hardware/processing needs and wishes
Before going to deep in the specifications of the system a list of needed and wished features must be established.
Besides the raw acquisition from ADCs and scan conversion, the embedded system will have to support additional features.
Identified features and functionalities include:
1. WiFi communication with the smartphone
2. Commands/configuration from the smartphone (gain adjustment, frequency,...)

To identify all needed and wished features a brainstorm document has been created by @rbo so that everyone can put his ideas:

### Processing split (Hardware/Embedded Software/Smartphone)
Today signal processing and scan conversion are performed on the embedded system (RedPitaya) and images are sent to the smartphone.
An analysis should be done to know the better way to split the processing between the embedded system and the smartphone. Should the embedded system perform the signal processing and scan conversion or should raw signals be sent to the smartphone and the processing done on the smartphone ?

### Hardware proposals
#### @jcbillard ####

__Main CPU__: 
[Texas Instruments OMAP-L138] (http://www.ti.com/product/OMAP-L138) 
* ARM9 + C674x DSP cores @450 MHz
* uPP (Universal Parallel Port) useful for interfacing ADC
* Available Linux support

__ADC__: 
[Texas Instruments ADS6142] (http://www.ti.com/product/ADS6142)

#### @rbo ####

__Main CPU__:

* ARM Cortex A7 single/dual core @ 1 GHz + ARM Cortex M4 @200 MHz:

__ADC__:


## Action items
How do we handle tasks/issues ? Github issues, [Markdown task lists] (https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments), bugtracker ?

Methodology to use on github repositories and way of handling tasks/issues to be discussed and harmonized at project level for all repositories/groups.

## Next meetup
January 6 2017, 20:00 to discuss some hardware specific stuff with @jcbillard
